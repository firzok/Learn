            \n Flowers are the reproductive parts of flowering plants. A flower is a special part of the plant. Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant. Flowers have petals. Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce pollen and seeds.\n
            Flowers are an important evolutionary advance made by flowering plants. Some flowers are dependent upon the wind to move pollen between flowers of the same species. Their pollen grains are light-weight. Many others rely on insects or birds to move pollen. Theirs are heavier. The role of flowers is to produce seeds, which are contained in fruit. Fruits and seeds are a means of dispersal. Plants do not move, but wind, animals and birds spread the plants across the landscape.\n

            Mosses donot absorb water. Instead they anchor themselves in the soil.\n
            Water is absorbed by the whole body of the plant, like a piece of sponge. They need to grow near water so their bodies can absorb water.\n
